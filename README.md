Images Library with example for Android

When building with Eclipse, add a project with 'Import' -> 'Existing Android Code into Workspace' and select both the library and the example. Make sure to compile the library first.

When building from the command line, it's enough to enter the ImagesExample folder and type 'ant debug' or 'ant build'.
